Linear Search       
                traversing and checking each element of the array


COMPLEXITY      -       O(n)   


Binary Seach       
                arranging into ascending, then the first element will be low and last will be high, if the element we are searching
for is neither high nor low then we will find the mid element i.e. (high+low)/2 and then checking the mid value whether it is the element
we are seaching for, if not then compare the element we are searching for with the mid value and then the element we are seaching for is 
smaller then the mid value then will be making mid value to high,   and if the element we are searching for is greater then the mid value then
we will be taking the mid valye as the low, and traversing to find the element.... and so on..... 

        e.g.    if we are given a book of about 1000pages and we have to search for page 456, then we will take to mid page of the book and the 
                then comparing is it smaller or bigger than the mid page.
